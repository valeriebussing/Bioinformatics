# This is a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis performed on a ranked list of genes which are differentially expressed in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells compared to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The dataset contains 48 samples of patient data, 24 of which are ALL cells and 24 are AML cells. The gene expression levels measured in the 48 samples are ranked by their p-values multiplied by the level of up-or downregulation (log 2-fold change). In other words, when a particular gene is significantly downregulated in ALL cells, it is expressed more often in AML cells than in ALL cells.
